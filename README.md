# TODO
- I only work in  “Specializations” and “Contact Us” sections, because "Who we are" section was very similar to “Specializations”. 
- Adding a linter.
- Adding a module loader (webpack).
- Adding unit test.
- Modularize the app, adding a module for “Specializations”.
- Create a route for every section inside about US.
- Add hooks, for example to a precommit action: run linter ans tests.
- Use npm scripts for automation.
- Generate automatically a production build.
